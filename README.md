## About the Exzo Network 
* Exzo Network uses a modular architecture and provides Ethereum compatibility.
* Users able to interact with industry standard wallets through JSON-RPC.
* Develop with Solidity/Vyper, full EVM support.
* Build using widely-adopted Ethereum tooling, libraries and development tools.
* Streamlined UX when doing cross-chain operations.
* Go beyond Ethereumâ€™s Smart Contracts with Runtime plugins.

The Exzo Network Token (XZO) features the following utilities, and the value of XZO token will accrue with the increased usage of the network and revenue from stability fees and liquidation penalties.

* As Network Utility Token: to pay for network fees and stability fees.
* As Governance Token: to vote for/against risk parameters and network change proposals.
* As Economic Capital: in case of liquidation without sufficient collaterals.
* As fee reducing token on decentralized applications and wallets upon the Exzo Network.
* For staking to help secure the Exzo Network in a decentralized fashion.

Cross-Chain Communication
* Completely trustless and decentralized built-in Ethereum Bridge solution.
* Transfer assets to and from any EVM compatible network, most notably Exzo Network and Ethereum mainnets.
* Transfer ERC-20 tokens, NFTs or wrapped native currencies.
* Customize the bridge functionality using Bridge plugins.

### Build from Source (Ubuntu 20.04)
Requirements - `Go >=1.18.x`

#### Setup Go Path
```
sudo nano ~/.profile
```
Paste this into the bottom of the file
```
export GOPATH=$HOME/work
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```
```
source ~/.profile
```

#### Install Go
```
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.18.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvf go1.18.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv go /usr/local && rm go1.18.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
Check that it's installed
```
go version
```
You should see something like this:
```
go version go1.18.7 linux/amd64
```

#### Build Exzo Network
```
git clone https://github.com/ExzoNetwork/ExzoCoin.git
cd ExzoCoin/
go build -o exzocoin main.go
```

#### Setup a Validator Node (optional)
You can setup your node as a validator to help secure the network. You can follow [this guide](ValidatorGuide.md) to setting one up. 

#### Running a Non-validating Node
After you have [downloaded](https://github.com/ExzoNetwork/Exzo-Network-Core/releases/latest) the binaries or [built from source](https://github.com/ExzoNetwork/ExzoCoin#build-from-source), enter the `ExzoCoin` directory and run the following:
```
mkdir ~/.exzocoin
```
```
./exzocoin server --data-dir ~/.exzocoin --chain mainnet-genesis.json --libp2p 0.0.0.0:1478 --nat <public_or_private_ip>
```
